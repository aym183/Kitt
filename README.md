# Kitt

Kitt is an iOS application that allows creators in the UAE to create and manage custom storefronts to sell products directly via their link-in-bio. The creators must make an account, set up their web pages, and add their products to the catalogue. Doing so creates a route that fetches the relevant data when users input the right URL.

Users can browse through their favourite creators' storefronts, view their endorsed links and products, and buy directly via Stripe. The users interacted through a website and the creators managed storefronts through the application.
